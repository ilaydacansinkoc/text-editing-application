# Text Editing Application with Composite Design Pattern
CENG 431 HW#3

You should fulfill the concepts of;
```
•	Composite Design Pattern
•	SOLID principles
```
Suppose you are developing a text editing application which is composed of components that are also responsible of editing a text. Components will:

1.	Take text input from user and save it into a file
2.	Perform automatic text correction of a given text
3.	Count number of paragraph, line, word, and characters of a given text 
4.	Search, list, and count the words containing inputted characters (like CTRL+F command) in a given text. For example, when the user enters “ck” characters, the output will be “back, slack” words in the given text.

Text could be given both through user input from console or through a file. For automatic correction, you can use the jar file attached or open the link given below, download and update the project to use it. The given jar file is a changed version of the project in the given link. If you want to change the project and use it, make sure it also follows object-oriented programming principles.

Implement necessary classes and an App class that demonstrates all implemented functionality.
